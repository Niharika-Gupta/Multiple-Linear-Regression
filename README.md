# Multiple-Linear-Regression

Multiple linear regression (MLR) is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory(Categorical) variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. The goal of multiple linear regression (MLR) is to model the relationship between the explanatory and response variables.

Here in this repo we will learn to interpret and understand if our model fits. We will be trying to predit a home value based on categorical variables. We will learn about different models, coefficients, Multicolinearity, VIFs use of dummy variables while analysis for linear regression.

Here is a glimpse of what we will be doing.
